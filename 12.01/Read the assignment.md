// Create a function that takes a number as its only argument and returns true if it's less than or equal to zero, otherwise return false.

// Examples:

// isLEQZero(3) ➞ false
// isLEQZero(0) ➞ true
// isLEQZero(-4) ➞ true
// isLEQZero(10) ➞ false

//  Dog Years. Create a function which calculates how old a dog is in dog years. The function should accept one argument that is the dog's age in human years.
//PS:  calculate the dog's age in dog years based on the calculation of 1 human year = 7 dog years.

// Example:

// dogAge(4) ➞ "Your doggy is 28 years old in dog years!"

//  A Lifetime Supply...
// You just won a lifetime supply of your favorite snack! The snack company needs to calculate what that actually means and how much they need to give you over your "lifetime". Create a function to help you calculate that amount for yourself to make sure you get the right amount. The function should accept two arguments: person age and the amount he will eats per day. The function should calculate the amount that will be consumed for the rest of your life given a constant maximum age of 100.

// Examples:

// calcLifetimeSupply(25, 2) ➞ "The snack company should provide you with 54,788 units, until you are a ripe old age of 100. Happy snacking!"

// calcLifetimeSupply(40, 3) ➞ "The snack company should provide you with 65,745 units, until you are a ripe old age of 100. Happy snacking!"

console.log("--------Exercise-------");
//  Number to Month Name
// Create a function that takes a number (from 1 to 12) and returns its corresponding month name as a string.
// For example, if you're given 3 as input, your function should return "March", because March is the 3rd month.
//  here are the months array as a small help :)
//   let months = [ "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December" ];

// Examples:

// monthName(3) ➞ "March"
// monthName(12) ➞ "December"
// monthName(6) ➞ "June"

console.log("--------Exercise-------");
// Try to do it by yourself and don't look in yesterday solution. I trust you :)
// Count Occurrences.
// Create a function that accepts two arguments: a string and a letter. The function should count the number of occurrences of that letter in the string.

// Example:

// countOccurrences("this is a string", "i") ➞ 3
